\section Motivation Motivation

The idea of this project templates is to have a Walking Skeleton as starting point for a C++ project. The project template contains the following targets:
<ul>
<li>A Dummy [google test] (http://code.google.com/p/googletest/) unit test</li>
<li>A Dummy BDD Style (Gherkin) feature test using [Cucumber] (http://cukes.info/) and [Cucumber-cpp] (https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-cpp)</li>
<li>A Dummy BDD Style (Context/Specification) component test using [CppSpec] (https://github.com/tpuronen/cppspec)</li>
<li>A Dummy BDD Style test using [Igloo] (http://igloo-testing.org/) testing framework</li>
<li>A Dummy BDD Style test using [Catch] (https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) testing framework</li>
<li>[SonarQube] (http://www.sonarqube.org/) project file</li>
<li>[Doxygen](www.doxygen.org) generated documentation</li>
<li>A packages target which generates a [NSIS] (http://nsis.sourceforge.net) based installer (Windows) or a [Debian package] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_%28file_format%29 ) (Linux)</li>
<li>Makefile to build, run tests and measure metrics under Linux</li>
</ul>

\note
Note that my definition of a <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Walking+skeleton" target="_blank">Walking Skeleton</a> is not as defined in the literature, since it doesn't cut through the final architecture. 
However it is a Walking Skeleton in the sense that it includes everything a C++ project possibly needs.
